## How it works?

Lingo Letter draws inspiration from the [TELC B1 German Exam](https://www.telc.net/sprachpruefungen/deutsch/zertifikat-deutsch-telc-deutsch-b1). In the TELC exam, one of the tasks is to compose a response to a given letter within 30 minutes. Essentially, Lingo Letter serves as a simulator for TELC letter assignments.

Currently, Lingo Letter supports the following languages:

* ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ English
* ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ Spanish
* ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· French
* ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª German
* ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ Italian
* ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ Portuguese

:warning: Lingo Letter is a browser-only app. You'll need to set **your own OpenAI API key**.

* Add audio
* %YOUR_IDEA%
