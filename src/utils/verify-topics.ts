      I have a ${emailLanguage} letter here between ''' symbols:

      '''${letter}'''


      Are the following topics directly covered in the letter: ${topics.join(', ')}? Rate each topic on the following scale:

      0 â€“ not covered at all.
      1 - the topic is briefly mentioned in the letter.
      2 - there're at least one sentence with 2 parts in the letter about the topic. There're also 1-2 not so complex sentences around the topic.

      Respond in the JSON format and comment on what could I have done better for each topic:

      {
        TOPIC: {
          grade: 0/1/2,
          comment: ""
        }
      }
    `

  });

  return JSON.parse(topicsResponseMessage.content || "{}")
}
