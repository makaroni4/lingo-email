# Welcome to Lingo Email! ğŸ‘‹

If you're getting ready for a language exam or aiming to improve your writing skills in a foreign language, Lingo Email is the ideal tool for you.

Lingo Email draws inspiration from the [TELC B1 German Exam](https://www.telc.net/sprachpruefungen/deutsch/zertifikat-deutsch-telc-deutsch-b1). In the TELC exam, one of the tasks is to compose a response to a given email within 30 minutes. Essentially, Lingo Email serves as a simulator for TELC email assignments.
