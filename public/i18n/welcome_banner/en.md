Hi, it's [Anatoli](https://www.x.com/makaroni4), maker of the **Email Writing Trainer**! ğŸ‘‹

If you're gearing up for a language exam or just looking to enhance your writing skills in a foreign language, EWT is the perfect tool for the job. ğŸš€

I built EWT to prepare for a [TELC B1 German Exam](https://www.telc.net/sprachpruefungen/deutsch/zertifikat-deutsch-telc-deutsch-b1). In the TELC test, one of the assignments is to compose a response to an E-mail within 30 minutes. Your submission should cover designated topics and include some complex sentences to demonstrate a solid grasp of grammar. Basically, EWT is a TELC E-mail assignment simulator.

The E-mail is gerenated via Chat GPT, so you'll have to set your API key in the [settings tab](#settings) ([a note on where to get API key](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-api-key)).

At the moment, EWT supports the following languages:

* ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ English
* ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¸ Spanish
* ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡· French
* ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª German
* ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡¹ Italian
* ğŸ‡µğŸ‡¹ Portuguese

I should mention, that this project is [open-source](https://github.com/makaroni4/email_simulator) and doesn't track any data.

Enjoy EWT and I hope it'll help you to ace your exam! ğŸ’Œ
